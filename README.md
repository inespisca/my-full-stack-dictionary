## Full stack dictionary

Deployed to heroku: https://fullstack-dictionary.herokuapp.com/

Full stack version of this frontend only dictionary: https://github.com/inespisca/javascript-dictionary

This is a simple dictionary with no authentication, which means anyone is welcome to add words on the deployed version. Also, feel free to add words, edit them and delete them. Just please, don't delete all of them so everybody can see it works. This was created out of my own curiosity, I've always wanted to make a dictionary myself.

## Content - Dictionary
As soon as the webpage is loaded, one can see all the words in the dictionary organized by alphabetical order, like a dictionary should be. Each word has three different categories: Word, Definition and Related words. There's a searchbar to filter the words one gets: that searchbar will filter any letter present in a word. It means that, for example, if one types "human", it'll appear the words "baby" and "eye", because the description of both include the word "human".

## Content - Backoffice
In front of each word there's an "edit" button, which will allow anyone to edit an existant word in the database or even delete it. There's also an Add a Word link, which will lead to an empty form to fill in, that will add a new word into the database.
Feel free to try it out and have fun!
